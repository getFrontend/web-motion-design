# About

In this motion design training project, I practice how how to include motion in my web design projects using video, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, SVG, Lottie, and more.

This will help bring websites to life and make them more interesting and memorable.

## What is Motion Design?

Motion design is a creative discipline that uses **animation** and **visual effects** to bring statuc elements to life. It involves manipulating visual elements like **text**, **illustations** and **images** to create engaging and dynamic **motion graphics**.

## Remember

* Not all CSS properties support transitions, like for example **background**. However, there are workarounds, one of which being the use of **pseudo-elements**.

* Not all transitions in a page need the same **duration**. Sometimes, using a longer transition among shorter ones can create a very satisfying movement.
